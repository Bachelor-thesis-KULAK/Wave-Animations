# Wave-Animations

This repository contains the animations corresponding to the simulations created for the bachelor project 'Chaos in the Wave Equation: Dynamic Boundary Conditions on a String'. 

A summary of the content:
	Part 1)
		(1) Interpolation method: simulation of linear/quadratic/cubic (NOT ADDED YET)
		(3) Numercial: first timestep/lambda instability/sharp pulse instability 
		(10) simulations -> (8) analytically solvable (basic) and (2) other conditions

	Part 2)
		(5) Result of the wave from Chen's  examples
		(1) All numerical schemes (NOT ADDED YET)
		(1) Damped wave equation, with non-damped analytical solution (NOT ADDED YET)
		(1) Alternative damped solving method (NOT ADDED YET)
