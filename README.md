# Wave Animations

This repository contains the animations corresponding to the simulations created for the bachelor project [Chaos in the Wave Equation: Dynamic Boundary Conditions on a String](https://github.com/Bachelor-thesis-KULAK/Wave-Animations).

A summary of the content:

- **Part 1**
  - (2) Interpolation method: simulation of linear/quadratic/cubic for different L
  - (6) Numerical: (1) first timestep/ (1) lambda instability / (1) sharp pulse instability / (3) L instability
  - (10) simulations -> (8) analytically solvable (basic) and (2) other conditions

- **Part 2**
  - (2) Example map F for fixed and free boundary
  - (1) All numerical schemes
  - (1) Damped wave equation, with non-damped analytical solution
  - (1) Alternative damped solving method
  - (5) Result of the wave from Chen's examples
