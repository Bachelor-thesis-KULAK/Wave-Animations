# Wave-Animations

This repository contains the animations corresponding to the simulations created for the bachelor project 'Chaos in the Wave Equation: Dynamic Boundary Conditions on a String'. 

A summary of the content:

- **Part 1**
  - (2) Interpolation method: simulation of linear/quadratic/cubic for different L
  - (3) Numerical: first timestep/lambda instability/sharp pulse instability 
  - (10) simulations -> (8) analytically solvable (basic) and (2) other conditions
  
- **Part 2**
  - (5) Result of the wave from Chen's examples
  - (1) All numerical schemes
  - (1) Damped wave equation, with non-damped analytical solution
  - (1) Alternative damped solving method
